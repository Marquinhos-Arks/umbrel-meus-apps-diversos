# EmulatorJS on Umbrel

Once the app is installed, you can access the backend interface at:

**http://umbrel.local:3662/**

## Getting Started

Begin by using the backend interface to download the default artwork and configuration files.  
This will set up a basic folder structure inside the appâ€™s `profile` directory.

Next, add your ROM files to the corresponding folders within the `roms` directory.  
The backend will walk you through adding them to the web frontend, which is available at:

**http://umbrel.local:8662/**

## Browser Recommendations

For optimal performance it's best to use a Chromium-based browser like:

- **Chrome**
- **Chromium**
- **Brave**
- **Edge**

**Firefox** is also supported, but may run with reduced performance and lacks tested controller support.

## More Information

Further details and configuration options are available in the official documentation:
