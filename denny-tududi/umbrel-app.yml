  âœ… Tududi is a minimalist task and project management application designed to help users organize their work and personal life with a strong focus on privacy and flexibility. It offers a clean and intuitive interface that works smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, enabling productivity anytime and anywhere. The application features intelligent recurring task management, allowing users to create tasks that repeat on daily, weekly, monthly, or more complex schedules, with support for parent-child task relationships to enhance organization and workflow.


  The project structure is hierarchical, dividing work into areas, projects, and tasks, which aligns well with popular productivity methods like Getting Things Done. Users can separate different life domains such as work, personal, health, or learning, providing clear focus and balance. Tasks can be enriched with priorities, due dates, and custom tags, and powerful filtering and sorting options help quickly find and manage important items.


  Tududi also supports project documentation by allowing users to add notes, meeting minutes, and reference materials within projects in a searchable and organized manner. Integration with messaging platforms like Telegram enables quick task creation from messages and daily summaries, making task capture seamless. With multi-language support and a strong commitment to data privacy, Tududi offers a modern and powerful productivity tool that balances simplicity with advanced features for individuals and teams who want full control over their workflow and information.
