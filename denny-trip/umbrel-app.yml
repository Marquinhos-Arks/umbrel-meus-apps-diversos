  🗺️ TRIP is a minimalist and privacy-focused trip planner that helps you organize your travel ideas and points of interest on an interactive map. Designed for self-hosting, it allows you to manage your travel data without relying on third-party services or cloud storage. The application combines a clean visual interface with a structured planning tool that resembles a spreadsheet, making it easy to document and categorize each destination.


  With TRIP, you can add detailed metadata to your points of interest such as whether a location is dog-friendly, how much it costs, or how long it takes to explore. The interface supports filtering and search functions so you can quickly navigate through your entries and refine your travel plans as needed. You can also import and export your data at any time, ensuring that your information remains portable and under your control.


  The platform places strong emphasis on privacy, offering a telemetry-free experience where nothing is tracked or shared. Everything runs locally, and the source code is fully open, allowing you to inspect, adapt, or contribute as you see fit. Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or a multi-country adventure, TRIP helps you stay organized while keeping your data safe and fully in your hands.
